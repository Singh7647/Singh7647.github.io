Problems I am thinking about these days:  
## Theory: 
[1] Learning Accuracy Preserving Low Resource DNN Models   
[2] Effects of LR Schedule on GD based Non-convex optimization methods  
[3] Understanding the Topology and geometry of DNNs  
[4] Manipulating the loss surface of DNNs  
[5] Learning Disentangled Respresentations  


## NLP:
[1] Paraphrase Detection and Generation  
[2] Text Classification  
[3] Named Entity Recognition  
[4] Learning universal Ontology  
[5] char-word-sentence Embedding  

## Dialog Agents
[1] Dialog Simulation    
[2] Unsupervised Dialog Evaluation   
[3] User Behavior Model  
[4] Automated Crowdsourcing to collect Dialog Data   
[5] Annotator Model (Automated Annotation Model)  
[6] User Agent Self Play  
[7] Information theoretic Coherence
